## jsopo - Precompiler providing operator overloading for JavaScript

Run "setup.py install" to start rocking. See "demo" folder for an actual example. Once you have installed the tool just invoke "jsopo" at that directory. You should see some test results. Feel free to tweak the files to give it a proper go.
